# Closest Point K-D tree data structure.
### this algorithm reads data from a file of 2D points then finds the closest point to a point the user enters it through input stream and then visulaize the result.

---
> ## prerequisites
---
* **g++-7.5 or g++-5.5**
* **OpenCV c++ API**

---

```bash
https://github.com/khshmt/closest_point_KDtree_data_structure.git

cd closest_point_KDtree_data_structure

make closest_point

./closest_point
```

## #NOTE
 ---
### ==> you can edit the "point.txt" file to enter as many point as you want but with the same format like the examples in the file.
